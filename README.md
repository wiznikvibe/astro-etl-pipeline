# Airflow ETL Pipeline with Postgres and API Integration In ASTRO Cloud And AWS
## **Description**

This project implements a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using **Apache Airflow**, orchestrated via **ASTRO Cloud** and deployed across **AWS** infrastructure. It integrates external **APIs** and a **PostgreSQL** database to automate data ingestion, transformation, and storage workflows.

### Key features include:

* 🚀 **Airflow DAGs** for modular and scalable task orchestration
* 🌐 **API integration** for real-time and batch data retrieval
* 🗄️ **PostgreSQL** support for structured data persistence
* ☁️ **ASTRO Cloud** deployment for managed Airflow infrastructure
* 🛠️ **AWS services** (e.g., S3, EC2) for scalable data processing and storage

This pipeline is designed for reliability, maintainability, and extensibility in cloud-based data engineering environments.
